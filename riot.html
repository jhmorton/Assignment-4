				<h3>Turkish tensions boil over on a cold night in Kadikoy</h3>

				<p class="columnText">But why? Well, while many of the youth generation are pushing for more progressive politics, it seems to them that Prime Minister Recep Erdogen is setting the country back to pre-Ataturk times. This is what my companion at the time, Ezgi, suggested that was the cause of this attack.</p>

				<p class="columnText">However, at the same time, it seems there was some activity called the <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/national_caferaga-squat-continues-despite-police-warnings_366398.html" target="blank">Caferaga Squat</a> - Caferaga being the small neighborhood in the Kadikoy district where we were. I am also sorry I missed seeing <a href="http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/woman-dances-in-front-of-riot-police-during-a-demonstration-news-photo/460183470" target="blank">this</a></p>

				<p class="columnText">As it stands, we first heard some commotion in the street - more a pedestrian thoroughfare than anything, then the sound of fireworks. Naturally, this drew our attention out the window, where we shortly saw a dozen or so people in black masks dash past, followed quickly by riot police and a cloud of pepper gas.</p>
